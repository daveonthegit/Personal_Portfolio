## Project Overview

This architectural visualization platform revolutionizes how architects present their designs to clients. Instead of static renderings, clients can explore buildings interactively, adjust lighting conditions, change materials, and take virtual toursâ€”all in real-time through their web browser.

## The Problem

Traditional architectural presentations rely on static images and pre-rendered videos, which:
- Limit client engagement and understanding
- Require expensive rendering farms for high-quality output
- Make design iterations time-consuming and costly
- Fail to convey spatial relationships and scale effectively

## Solution Architecture

<Callout type="success" title="Real-Time Innovation">
Developed a web-based platform that renders architectural models in real-time, allowing instant design modifications and client interaction.
</Callout>

### Key Features

- **Real-Time 3D Rendering**: Smooth 60fps navigation through complex architectural models
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Sun studies, artificial lighting, and shadow analysis
- **Material Editor**: Live material swapping and customization
- **Virtual Tours**: Predefined walkthrough paths with smooth camera transitions
- **Measurement Tools**: Real-time distance and area calculations
- **Collaboration Features**: Multi-user sessions with synchronized viewpoints

## Technical Implementation

### WebGL Optimization

The platform leverages advanced WebGL techniques for optimal performance:

```javascript
// Custom shader for architectural materials
const architecturalMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  uniforms: {
    uTime: { value: 0 },
    uLightPosition: { value: new THREE.Vector3() },
    uMaterialRoughness: { value: 0.5 },
    uEnvironmentMap: { value: environmentTexture }
  },
  vertexShader: `
    varying vec3 vWorldPosition;
    varying vec3 vNormal;
    
    void main() {
      vWorldPosition = (modelMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0)).xyz;
      vNormal = normalize(normalMatrix * normal);
      gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
    }
  `,
  fragmentShader: architecturalFragmentShader
});
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Automatic model simplification based on distance
2. **Frustum Culling**: Only render objects within camera view
3. **Instanced Rendering**: Efficient rendering of repeated elements
4. **Texture Streaming**: Progressive loading of high-resolution textures

### Data Pipeline

The platform integrates with popular architectural software:

- **Revit Integration**: Direct BIM model import with metadata preservation
- **SketchUp Support**: Native .skp file parsing and conversion
- **IFC Compatibility**: Building Information Modeling standard support
- **Custom Optimizations**: Automatic geometry optimization for web delivery

## User Experience Design

### Interface Design

The interface prioritizes architect and client workflows:

- **Minimal UI**: Clean interface that doesn't distract from the model
- **Context-Aware Tools**: Controls appear based on selected objects
- **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-optimized controls for tablet presentations
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation

### Interaction Patterns

```typescript
// Custom hook for architectural navigation
export function useArchitecturalControls() {
  const controlsRef = useRef<OrbitControls>()
  
  const enterWalkMode = useCallback(() => {
    if (controlsRef.current) {
      controlsRef.current.maxPolarAngle = Math.PI / 2.1
      controlsRef.current.minDistance = 1
      controlsRef.current.maxDistance = 50
    }
  }, [])
  
  const enterOverviewMode = useCallback(() => {
    if (controlsRef.current) {
      controlsRef.current.maxPolarAngle = Math.PI
      controlsRef.current.minDistance = 10
      controlsRef.current.maxDistance = 200
    }
  }, [])
  
  return { controlsRef, enterWalkMode, enterOverviewMode }
}
```
