# 3D Models Directory

This directory contains GLB/glTF model files for the portfolio.

## Adding Models

1. Export your model from Blender as GLB with these settings:
   - Format: glTF Binary (.glb)
   - Include: Selected Objects only
   - Transform: +Y Up
   - Geometry: Apply Modifiers, UVs, Normals, Tangents
   - Materials: Export Materials
   - Compression: Use Draco compression
   - Texture: Keep original or resize to 1K-2K

2. Optimize file size:
   - Use texture atlasing when possible
   - Compress textures to WebP or KTX2
   - Keep triangle count reasonable (under 50K for web)
   - Remove unnecessary vertices and faces

3. Test in gltf-viewer before deployment
